## Angie: Looking for Contributors!
More and more the software-development industry is going to look to JavaScript engineers for full-stack solutions. Angie allows these engineers to code more efficiently across the stack.

I've been curating the Angie project on my own since around April. It has made a lot of progress, but still has a long way to go! There is a lot on the TODO list I would like to get done before the 1.0 release, but it seems as though the amount of work is going to take longer to do alone than anticipated.

### Abridged TODO
I'm looking for some contributors to the project to help me do the following:

* Handle realtime 6-way data-binding support (plan included)
* Handle f2b form support
* Manage the ORM
* Create a caching module (using any preferred methodology)
* Manage the dependency injection module
* Manage the logging module
* Create a package manager for Angie packages
* Create a native desktop admin manager
* Create an Auth/CSRF package
* Add validators to the Angie REST Module
* Manage the documentation (I'm toying with the idea of creating a repo exclusively for documentation)

...so there is a lot to be done.

### Not Interested in Contributing?
Did you know that you can contribute implicitly without coding? Yeah! It's true! Star this repo if you think the project looks cool, tell your friends to do the same, or try the project out on your own and provide some feedback!

### Why Angie?
The Angie MVC is not a popular framework by any means necessary, due in part to my focus on making it feature complete as opposed to advertising it. I'm of the camp that there are a lot of good frameworks out there that are as good or better than the big four that have not gotten a lot of attention because of the community's annoyance with the amount of frameworks being created. I don't believe that Angie is yet one of those frameworks, but with your help, I would like to make it so. If you are looking for ES6, NodeJS, or package management support or are looking to play around with pretty much any related Node software, let me know!

If you are interested in the project and would like to own one of the dependency projects, I am more than happy to let you do so provided you plan to maintain as opposed to sit on the package. This is a good opportunity to start or brush up your NodeJS and NPM chops as well. It will also put you in contact with a lot more developers on GitHub.

There are a few existing NodeJS Application Frameworks out there, but Angie is unique for three reasons. It is build on a dependency-injection module as opposed to raw imports. A global application registers all of your modules in a fashion similar to AngularJS or React and exposes them for all of the project's Controllers/Views/etc. Angie is also micro-serviced in a very micro way. That is to say that the core library is very small and gives you control over what kinds of dependencies you actually want to include. It is very easy to create and include dependencies to the project using whichever NodeJS technologies you like, swap out existing modules, or remove any modules you do not explicitly need to use. The framework is written entirely in ES6 (using Babel), so it has a leg up on a lot of other technologies out there. Contributing to the project is a great opportunity to get in on something different and perhaps game-chaning.

### How to Contribute
If you're not interested after all of that, I'm not entirely surprised...maybe just a little. If you are interested, send me a line on twitter or GitHub (via my email) @benderTheCrime or send an email to the angie-mvc organization.

JavaScript Onward!
