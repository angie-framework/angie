    Angie will work with any version of npm 0.10.0+, however, I recommend using nvm.
    It cannot be downloaded via npm:

    Please visit this link and follow the instructions listed for iojs-2.0.0

<h2>First, we're going to need some packages!</h2>

<span class='content no-bottom'>
    In the directory you would like your project to live, please run the following
    command:
</span>

<pre>
    <code class='language-bash'>
        npm install -g babel gulp-cli angie
        angie createProject <name>
    </code>
</pre>

<span class='content no-bottom'>
    Where npm installs the babel, gulp, and angie packages globally and where
    this angie command creates a project in your current directory by the name
    entered. To see a full list of angie commands, use one of the following:
</span>

<pre>
    <code class='language-bash'>
        angie
        angie help
    </code>
</pre>

    Hopefully by now, you've got a scaffolded project. If so, it's possible
    to start building our app.
</span>

<h2>Now we can write some code!</h2>

<span class='content no-bottom'>
    I like to encourage proper developer behavior whenever possible. Therefore,
    for the time being, it is not possible to load modules outside of the folders
    which have been scaffolded. That is to say that modules outside of these
    folders will not be loaded. However, any type of module can live in any of
    the prescribed folders.

    Let's start by setting up some routes! In the configs directory, create a
    file called <p>routes.config.js</p> or <p>routes.config.es6</p>.
    Add the following code to that file:
</span>

<pre>
    <code class='language-javascript'>
        <span class 'token keyword'>import</span> app <span class 'token keyword'>from</span> <span class='token string'>'./Angular'</span>


        <span class='token keyword'>function</span><span class='token punctuation'>() {</span>
            console<span class='token punctuation'>.</span><span class='token function'>log</span><span class='token punctuation'>(</span><span class='token string'>'hi'</span><span class='token punctuation'>);</span>
        <span class='token punctuation'>}</span>
    </code>
</pre>
